# Skill Projects

Use this reference when a repository contains `skill-project.toml` or
`skill-manager-project.toml`, or when the user asks for a project-specific
agent harness.

## Mental Model

A skill project manifest is portable intent for one repository. It can
declare skills, plugins, doc-repos, harnesses, envs, libs, CLI deps, and
MCP deps. The generated files under the checkout are realized state, not
the source of truth.

Unit references in the manifest (skills, plugins, doc-repos, harnesses)
are resolved transitively at `project resolve` time, exactly like
`skill_references`. Use **git coords only** (`github:owner/repo`,
`git+…`, `file:…`); registry-name coords such as `skill:name` cannot
resolve because no registry is configured, and the coord names the repo,
not the installed unit — find it with `gh repo list <owner>`. The rule
and rationale live once in skill-publisher's
`references/coords-and-distribution.md` (imported above); do not restate
it here.

Project resolution also treats the checkout as a harness descriptor:

- The parent `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` records the registered project and
  project lock under `projects/<name>/`.
- `<project>/.skill-manager` is scaffolded as a child Skill Manager home.
- `<project>/.claude`, `<project>/.codex`, and `<project>/.gemini` are
  scaffolded as child-local agent homes.
- Resolved units are projected from the parent store into the child
  `.skill-manager` store.
- Parent child-home records claim the units while the project child home
  exists, so removals stay conservative.

Any Skill Manager home can itself be a parent. Do not assume there is a
distinguished global root.

## Homes Come In Tiers, And Every Tier Is A Copy

In practice a machine holds up to three:

```
root       ~/.skill-manager              where the operator installs
   |  copy  (project resolve, home clone)
project    <repo>/.skill-manager         one per repository, gitignored
   |  copy  (home clone)
worktree   <worktree>/.skill-manager     one per ticket, gitignored
```

Each tier is a **real copy, not a symlink**, and this is a deliberate design
decision rather than an implementation detail. A symlink farm makes the child and
the parent the same bytes; then "the agent's edit survived" and "the parent store
was not touched" become the same proposition, so neither can be violated and
neither can be checked. Copies make those two facts independent — which is what
lets two agents in two worktrees work at once without silently overwriting each
other's units.

Downward is easy: it is a copy, and `project resolve` / `home clone` do it.
**Upward is the whole difficulty**, and it is what the rest of this page is about.

The rule the mechanism enforces, and the one to reason from when a report
surprises you:

> A reconciliation may destroy bytes in the destination only where it can show
> the **source** passed through them.

Two consequences worth holding on to:

- **A materialization record is evidence about two different things.** Its
  content digest says "these are the bytes we wrote *here*" — about the
  destination alone. Its source/baseline fields say "this destination and *that*
  source last shared exactly this" — about a **pair** of homes. A record saying
  "I and the worktree last shared X" says nothing about whether the root home
  ever held X.
- **When unsure, conflict.** A merge base that is too old costs a spurious
  conflict a human resolves; one that is too new costs an edit nobody sees again.
  So `home sync` defaults to *hold back and report*, `--merge` reports conflicts
  rather than resolving them, and a conflicted unit writes **nothing**.

### Concurrency: what actually excludes what

Several worktrees can reconcile into one project home at the same time, so the
unit of exclusion is the **home**, not the unit: per-unit staging makes one
unit's swap atomic, but two whole-home syncs interleaved leave a destination
coherent per unit and incoherent as a home.

If you are writing code that needs that exclusion, the primitive is `HomeLock` —
a process-wide `ReentrantLock` keyed by the home path **plus** a `FileLock`. Both
are needed: a `FileLock` is held by the JVM rather than by the thread, so two
threads in one process do not exclude each other (the second gets
`OverlappingFileLockException` instead of waiting).

**`HarnessInstanceLock` is not a locking primitive.** Neither are `CliLock`,
`UnitsLock` or `SkillProjectLock`. They are lock *files* in the manifest sense —
durable JSON/TOML records of what is installed — with no exclusion semantics
whatsoever. Code that "reuses the existing lock" by reaching for one of those
gets no exclusion and no error.

And exclusion is not merging. Serialized syncs cannot corrupt a home, but the
second one is **held back and reported**: a result to read, not a step that
succeeded.

## Discovery

From a checkout, start with:

```bash
skill-manager project show <name>
skill-manager project list
<skill-manager-skill>/scripts/env.sh --pretty
```

`env.sh` reports the active `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME`, installed skills and
CLI shims, and, when run inside a skill project, passive project context:
manifest path, declared env names, child home path, and child-local agent
homes that exist.

## Register And Resolve

Use registration when you want the parent home to remember the manifest
intent:

```bash
skill-manager project register --project-dir <project>
```

Use resolve when dependencies should be installed, locked, bound, and
projected into the project child home:

```bash
skill-manager project resolve --project-dir <project>
```

**Order matters, and getting it wrong writes the operator's home.** `install`,
`sync`, `bind`, `upgrade` and `project resolve` all write into whatever
`SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` names, and `project resolve` additionally puts a child-home
record and a projection ledger into that store. Before a local home exists, that
store is the operator's global `~/.skill-manager`. So: create the local home
first, point `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` at it, and only then resolve — never the other
way round.

After resolve, project-local agent launches should point at the child
home and child-local agent homes:

```bash
SKILL_MANAGER_HOME=<project>/.skill-manager
CODEX_HOME=<project>/.codex
CLAUDE_HOME=<project>/.claude
GEMINI_HOME=<project>/.gemini
```

Use CLI help for exact flags such as JSON output, gateway skipping, lib
resolution, and custom manifest paths.

## Vendored Paths: `[[vendored]]`

A vendored path is the one thing a project checkout carries that the checkout
cannot describe by itself: a file or directory inside the working tree whose
*content* belongs to an installed unit, and which is therefore expected to be a
link into this project's own home. `test_graph/sdk` is the canonical case — a
tracked symlink, so git stores the target **bytes**, which means whatever
`SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` happened to be when the scaffolder ran is what every later
clone of that repository gets.

Nothing in the manifest said those paths were supposed to point anywhere in
particular, so nothing could say they were wrong. This block is that statement:

```toml
[[vendored]]
name = "test-graph-sdk"
paths = ["test_graph/sdk", "test_graph/build-logic", "test_graph/standard-nodes"]
from_unit = "test-graph"        # installed unit name; content comes from here
from_subpath = "project_sdk_sources"   # optional; omit when the unit root is the source
on_invalid = "error"            # error (default) | warn
```

An array of tables, like `[[libs]]`. `paths` are project-root-relative, must not
be absolute, and must not escape the project root — a path that escapes is the
very defect the block exists to catch, so it cannot be spelled in the
declaration. `name` identifies the group in diagnostics; it is not a filesystem
name. `paths` is per-declaration because the sets genuinely differ between
repositories.

Two things about how it is checked:

- **Validation compares resolved physical paths, not link text.** A link whose
  text is relative (`standard-nodes -> sdk/../standard-nodes`) matches no string
  test yet resolves *through an absolute sibling link* straight into the
  operator's home. Any check that reads link text misses that shape entirely.
- **Validation always runs; only the writing is opt-in.** `project resolve`
  reports findings by default. `project resolve --repair-vendored` re-points the
  declared paths at this project's own `.skill-manager` — off by default because a
  vendored path may be a tracked symlink, so repairing one edits your working
  tree. `project sync` takes the same flag.

`on_invalid = "error"` fails the command; the default is deliberate — a declared
contract that cannot fail is a comment. Use `"warn"` only for a project
mid-migration.

## Moving An Edit Up A Tier: `home sync`

An agent that improves a unit does it *inside a home*. The home is gitignored, so
that edit is in no diff, no PR, and no fan-out, and it is deleted with the
directory. `home sync` reconciles one home against another by copy:

```bash
skill-manager home sync --from <worktree>/.skill-manager \
                        --to <repo>/.skill-manager [--merge] [--dry-run] [--json]
```

- `--from` is **never written**. `--to` is written unless `--dry-run`.
- Without `--merge`, a destination unit that has been edited is **held back and
  reported**, not overwritten. That is the default because holding back costs a
  conflict and overwriting costs an edit nobody sees again.
- `--merge` three-way merges such a unit against its recorded per-file baseline.
  Conflicts are **reported, never resolved**; local work is kept either way and a
  conflicted unit writes nothing.
- `--dry-run` computes and prints the whole report and writes nothing at all — no
  records, no lock file. Use it to ask the question without answering it.

`home sync` is local to this machine and moves an edit exactly one tier. It does
not reach any other project.

## Publishing An Edit: `unit publish`

```bash
skill-manager unit publish <name> [--ticket T] [--home H] [--child-home DIR] \
                                  [--base main] [--remote origin] \
                                  [--direct] [--no-pr] [--dry-run] [--json]
```

This commits the home's edits to that unit on `skill/<ticket>-<unit>`, pushes, and
opens a pull request against the unit's trunk. `--ticket` defaults to
`$SKILL_MANAGER_TICKET`; `--child-home` is for a unit materialized into a project
child home as its own checkout (see `project sync --checkout UNIT`); `--direct`
pushes straight to the base with no review; `--no-pr` pushes the branch only.

**`home sync` and `unit publish` are not alternatives.** They answer different
questions, and both are needed:

| | `home sync` | `unit publish` |
|---|---|---|
| Moves | home → home, one tier up | home → the unit's own git repo |
| Reaches | the tier above, on this machine | every project, on every machine |
| Answers | "will closing this worktree destroy the edit?" | "will anyone else ever get this improvement?" |

A chain-only design would need the same improvement merged up twice and would
still never reach a **sibling** project. If you improved a unit, `unit publish`
is the one you owe.

## Discarding A Child Home: `home close-out`

Removing a worktree deletes its home without asking, and succeeds exactly as
quietly whether the home held a week of work or nothing. Ask first:

```bash
skill-manager home close-out --home <worktree>/.skill-manager \
                             --into <repo>/.skill-manager [--json]
```

- `--home` is the home about to be removed; `--into` is the **project home its
  work has to reach first** — the one it was cloned from, not `~/.skill-manager`.
  Get the pair wrong and the verdict is about the wrong two homes.
- It **writes nothing** and is safe to run repeatedly.
- **Exit 0** means it has established there is nothing to lose.
- **Exit 1** is the blocked verdict, and the only exit that prints blockers: every
  blocking unit, its status, and a **literal remedy command** per unit —
  `home sync` for a fast-forward, `home sync --merge` for a merge or a conflict
  (with the conflicted files listed), `unit publish` for a git checkout carrying
  unpushed work that a file copy cannot carry.
- **Exit 2** (`NotAHomeException`) means the path presented as a home is not one.
  Nothing was assessed and nothing is printed. This exit exists because the gate
  used to answer `safe: true` for a `--home` that was the worktree **directory**
  rather than its `.skill-manager` — and that directory is exactly what
  `git worktree remove` takes.
- **Exit 9** (`FrozenHomeException`) means the destination home's policy is
  `frozen`, so the gate — a dry-run sync into it — was refused and **nothing was
  attempted**. Branch on this separately in any teardown script: `9` ("refused,
  nothing attempted") is not `1` ("this worktree still holds work").
- A `LINKED` unit **blocks**. The gate cannot say whose bytes a symlink's target
  is — it may point inside the worktree or outside it — and "cannot tell" has to
  block rather than clear. Resolve the link, then re-run.
- `--json` gives `.blockers[]` with `unit`, `status`, `conflicts[]` and `remedy`.

There is **no `--force` on this command**, deliberately: the CLI owns the verdict.
The override lives in the caller —
`git-integration-repo`'s `close-change.sh <ticket> --force` still runs the gate and
still prints every blocker, and only declines to stop. A named, loud override is
safer than the `rm -rf` an operator improvises when a gate has no escape hatch.

`close-change.sh` runs this gate before `git worktree remove` and refuses (exit 4)
on a non-zero verdict, which is what makes "push back before teardown" a mechanism
rather than a discipline.

## Project Envs

Project envs are declared in the manifest and materialized under
`.skill-manager/envs/<env>/` as uv projects. Use:

```bash
skill-manager env sync <env> --project-dir <project>
skill-manager env run <env> --project-dir <project> -- <command>
```

Generated `.skill-manager/env.md`, env `pyproject.toml`, vendor
checkouts, and tool shims are derived from the manifest and lock. Update
the manifest, then re-run the CLI instead of editing generated env files
by hand.

## The Rest Of The `home` Family

Run `skill-manager home <sub> --help` for flags; this is the routing map.

| Subcommand | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| `clone --to` | Make a new home from an existing one, skipping re-derivable `cache/`, and verify nothing in the copy still points at the original. This — not `project resolve` — is how a checkout an agent works in gets its home. |
| `verify --home --against` | Assert a home holds no absolute reference back to another home. |
| `policy [live\|frozen]` | Declare a home mutable, or evidence. A **frozen** home refuses sync, upgrade and push-back, and is never modified in place. |
| `describe [--json] [--write]` | The `home.runtime.json` interop descriptor: the env to export, the resolved CLI, the gateway, the installed-unit snapshot, the policy. |
| `shims` | Generate `bin/launch/{claude,codex,gemini}`. Launch through these rather than exporting variables: skills also load from the Claude config dir, and `skill-script` CLI deps are generated shell scripts with a home's absolute path in the body that no variable redirects. |
| `drift [--record] [--ack]` | Show/record/acknowledge unit changes. A launch refuses while a change is unacknowledged, so an agent cannot keep acting on a skill that moved underneath it. |

`describe`, `policy`, `shims` and `drift` take `--init` to lay out a home at a path
that is not one yet. Without `--init` they refuse — a mistyped path should not get a
home scaffolded at it.

A cloned home and a `project resolve` child home both want the path
`<project>/.skill-manager`, and they are not the same thing. Resolving a root
against that root's own home makes the home its own child: it isolates nothing,
because there is nothing to be isolated from. `project resolve` refuses that layout
unless you pass `--allow-same-home`. Use the clone for a checkout an agent works
in; use `project resolve` when the parent home lives somewhere else.

## Cleanup

Use the owning CLI flow to remove generated state:

- `skill-manager project remove <name>` or
  `skill-manager project remove --project-dir <project>` for project
  registrations, child-home claims, generated child-store state, and
  project-managed bindings.
- `skill-manager harness rm <id>` for harness child homes.
- Re-run `skill-manager project resolve` after removing project
  dependencies from the manifest so stale child units and claims are
  pruned.
- Use `skill-manager bindings`, `unbind`, and `rebind` for doc bindings
  instead of deleting managed import blocks manually.

If `remove` says a unit is still claimed by a project or child home,
inspect the project lock and child-home record before deleting anything.
